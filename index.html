        <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am from Atlanta, GA. I am a prospective Computer Science student as
          I love technology and math as a whole. In my free time, I like to
          watch movies, play basketball with friends, code/learn new things, and
          hike.
        </p>

        <p>
          Orignating from deep Indian roots, I love everything regarding the
          Bollywood industry - both movies and music.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also in love with space exploration and theoretical discussions.
          As an enthusiast, I watch a podcast called Star Talk daily hosted by
          Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice.

        <h2>üßë‚Äçüíº Work History</h2>

        <h3>Coding "Sensei" || Code Ninjas</h3>
        <p>
          I passionately introduce complex concepts to young students by
          breaking them down into manageable chunks. I also have constructed and
          implemented curriculum for a video production summer camp, teaching 30
          students aged 5-16 about the basics of video editing, game design, and
          3D animation.
        </p>
        <h3>Intern || Solutionz, Inc.</h3>
        <p>
          I developed Sharepoint website for the company intranet, which
          resulted in a more efficient way for employees to access documents and
          information. Concurrently, I efficiently communicated complex
          information to a wide variety of people, resulting in many eligible
          school districts applying for specific grants.
        </p>
        <h3>Tutor || StudyBuds</h3>
        <p>
          I mentor students with difficulty in Math and Science subjects,
          raising grades by a significant amount.
